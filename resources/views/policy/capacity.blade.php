                            To strengthen capacities as well as better utilize research, IAPRI in 2015 will initiate a
                            scholarship program to support master’s level thesis research aligned to the CAFP strategic
                            thematic area, Poverty, Health, Food and Nutrition Security; Agricultural Transformation,
                            Institutions, Markets and Trade Development; and Technology, Climate-Resilient Agriculture
                            and Food Systems. In addition to offering students resources and collaboration opportunities
                            to build their research capabilities, the scholarship program aims to enhance the relevance
                            of agricultural and food policy research to improving the effectiveness of agricultural and
                            rural development strategies in Zimbabwe.

                        <p>
                            The idea behind the program is to make researchers
                            more accountable to stakeholders in the sector. By informing students of issues that
                            policymakers and donors are interested in and would like research on, CAFP hopes to enhance
                            the research that comes out of the various Master’s level programs at universities around
                            the country so that stakeholders in the agricultural sector can actually use the information
                            students are producing to implement agricultural and rural development strategies.
